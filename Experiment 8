Package Management in Linux 
Linux distributions generally fall into two packaging "ecosystems." As a professional, you must 
understand both. A package is a compressed archive containing: 
• Software binaries 
• Configuration files 
• Metadata (version, dependencies, scripts) 
Package managers simplify software management by automating:
• Installation 
• Upgrade 
• Removal 
• Dependency handling 
System vs. Language Managers 
• System Managers (APT/YUM): Manage the Operating System and shared utilities. 
• Language Managers (NPM/Pip): Manage libraries for a specific programming language 
(e.g., JavaScript/Node.js). They usually reside "on top" of the system manager.
A. Working with Linux (Hands-on) 
1. Update Repository Index: sudo apt update
2. Search for a utility (e.g., tree): apt search tree
3. Install the utility: sudo apt install tree
4. Verify Installation: tree --version
5. View Package Details: dpkg -s tree
6. Remove the utility: sudo apt remove tree
DPKG (Debian Package) 
dpkg is the low-level package manager for Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu). It is 
used to install, remove, and provide information about .deb packages but does not 
automatically download dependencies.
